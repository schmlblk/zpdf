Description:
    Stubs out a new PDF producer and its views. Pass the producer name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of document names as arguments.

    This generates a producer class in app/pdf_producers and invokes your template
    engine and test framework generators.

Example:
    `rails generate z_pdf:producer Forms invoice receipt`

    creates a Forms producer class and views:
        PDF Producer:   app/pdf_producers/forms.rb
        Views:          app/views/forms/invoice.erb
                        app/views/forms/receipt.erb
